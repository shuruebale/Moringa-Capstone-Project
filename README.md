# **CDC Diabetes Health Indicators Project**

## **Introduction and Data Understanding**
The goal of this project is to predict diabetes occurrence using a dataset of health indicators provided by the CDC. The main objective is to identify key factors that influence diabetes prevalence and develop a predictive model for early detection and prevention. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to create a robust model that can accurately predict diabetes risk and provide actionable insights for public health interventions.

**Dataset:** Includes health indicators such as BMI, physical activity levels, cholesterol levels, and demographic and lifestyle factors.  
**Target Variable:** `diabetes_binary` (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Non-Diabetic).

## **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**
### **Imputation Techniques:**
- **Continuous Variables:** Applied mean/median imputation using `SimpleImputer` from `sklearn.impute` for variables like BMI and Age.
- **Categorical Variables:** Used mode imputation for categorical features like Sex and Education.

### **Feature Engineering:**
- **BMI Categories:** Transformed BMI values into categorical bins (e.g., Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, Obese) using `pd.cut()` for more meaningful insights.
- **Age Binning:** Grouped ages into predefined bins (e.g., 0-18, 19-35, 36-50, 51-65, 66+) to improve model performance.

### **Bivariate Analysis:**
- **Cross-tabulation:** Explored the relationship between `diabetes_binary` and features like HighBP, HighChol, and PhysActivity.
- **Correlation Matrix:** Computed correlations to understand relationships between `diabetes_binary` and continuous features like BMI, Age, and Income.
- **Visualizations:** Used bar plots, point plots, and violin plots to represent associations between the target variable and other features.

## **Data Balancing**
### **Techniques Applied:**
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):** Generated new samples for the minority class by interpolating between existing samples.
- **NearMiss:** Reduced the majority class by selecting the closest samples to the minority samples.
- **SMOTETomek:** Combined oversampling and undersampling techniques to achieve a balanced dataset by removing Tomek links.

### **Normalization:**
Standardized continuous features using `StandardScaler` to scale features to have zero mean and unit variance.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
### **Key Observations:**
- **BMI and General Health:** High BMI is significantly associated with poor general health. Older populations are more prone to obesity-related health issues.
- **Income and Age:** Older individuals generally have lower income levels, which may influence health outcomes.
- **Physical Inactivity:** A strong predictor of diabetes.
- **High Blood Pressure and Cholesterol:** Prevalent among diabetic individuals, indicating the need for integrated healthcare approaches.
- **Smoking Habits:** More common among those with diabetes, highlighting the need for smoking cessation programs.
- **Mental Health:** Slight association between poor general health and mental health issues.
- **Healthcare Access:** Limited access is more common among lower-income and older individuals, potentially contributing to higher diabetes rates.
